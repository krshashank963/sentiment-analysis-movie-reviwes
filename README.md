# sentiment-analysis-movie-reviwes
 Measure sentiment of customer support tickets, survey responses, social media, and movie reviews!
 
 We will use the Stanford Large Movie Reviews dataset for training our model. The dataset is compiled from a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. It contains an equal number of positive and negative reviews. The authors considered only highly polarized reviews. Negative reviews have scores ≤ 4 (out of 10), while positive reviews have score ≥ 7. Neutral reviews are not included. The dataset is divided evenly into training and test sets.

We will:

Preprocess text data for NLP

Build and train a 1-D CNN using Keras and Tensorflow

Evaluate our model on the test set

Run the model on your own movie reviews!
